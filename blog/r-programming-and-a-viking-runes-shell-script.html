<p>So i've had a lot of projects going on lately but im very excited about them. First i've been loading a lot of new content to youtube namely a lot of videos on <code>RMarkdown</code>, but now i have another new series coming out. My new series on youtube at this playlist: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3baSluixcd4&list=PL5fd4SsfvECyFyM-jf2SFf4XCnfjbiWrX">HERE</a>. This playlist focuses on comprehensive reviewing of functionality as well as real applications of the functions in the packages so they can immediately be used.</p>
<br>
<p>Im very excited by these projects becase i <b>LOVE</b> talking about <code>R</code> and by teaching about the packages it acutally causes me to learn more so i understand the material being presented.</p>
<br>
<p>At work i've basically written a book with the <code>R</code> package <code>Bookdown</code> on a proprietary computer language we use, but beyond that project and some one off assignments i've mostly been devoting my time, resources, and money to learning more <code>R</code>. I have spent almost $200 on <code>R</code> books lately and im learning more about the language every day. I have even developed my own <code>R</code> package at work for use in our assignments. Complete with <code>Roxygen2</code> documentation, <code>testthat</code> unit tests, and more. It has been a blast.</p>
<br>
<p>Lastly I got a bit obsessed with putting elder futhark nordic runes into my terminal emulator: <b>ST</b>. After figuring out that <b>ST</b> supports UTF&ndash;8 i changed my linux <code>$PS1</code> variable to show my terminal prompt user and host name in elder futhark runes. Now, me knowing that this was possible didn't stop there. No, i wrote a shell script that can read standard input and even a whole file and with tests and a lot of piped <code>sed</code> regex functions i can convert whole files to runes. Now i can work on being able to read them as well as english haha. If this script and the project interest you or you want to check them out, you can do so <a href="https://github.com/tallguyjenks/runes">At This Link</a> Thats all the updates i have right now, keep your eyes on my youtube and github for content :)</p>
