<p>I started using <code>GHI</code> for managing my GitHub issues a few days ago and already it's proving to be an invaluable tool. <code>GHI</code> will allow you to open, close, edit, comment, label, and more! GitHub issues from whatever GitHub repo you're currently in, inside your local file system. There is a little bit of configuration i.e. running a single command and not committing your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> to version control, but once done it's all seamless. <code>GHI</code> is installed through a couple ways but I just did <code>gem install ghi</code> and that did the trick.</p>
<br>
<p>I recently had my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tallguyjenks/fla.sh">fla.sh</a> project reviewed by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJ094P7wxaU">Brodie Robertson</a> and the review yielded a lot of good feedback, so to make sure I got all the feedback down I started making new issues in the repo to follow up on when I had some time. To keep watching the video and make new issues in real time, I simply just opened a terminal window next to the browser and used <code>ghi open</code> to start a new issue. New issues open in you <code>$EDITOR</code> so Vim for me, and the first line would be the title of the issue, and the subsequent lines are the body of the issue and with this program you can still take advantage of GitHub flavor markdown to have most of the essential features of GitHub issues that you know and love.</p>
<br>
<p>Needless to say I am thoroughly enjoying this program and I intend to make heavy use of it in the days to come. It is now occupying a central place in my GitHub work flow.</p>
