<p>I decided to finally mess around with the Suckless Simple Terminal <strong>ST</strong>, and add the latest work from <a target="_blank" href="www.lukesmith.xyz">luke smith</a> to get color emoji support in ST. I forked Luke's repo, then installed the necessary dependency <code>libxft-bgra</code> for the emoji's and we were off to the races.</p>
<br>
<p>Next I <code>sudo make install</code> so I had the latest build of ST from Luke with the emoji support and then I made a branch on the repo to test out the  ligatures before committing to the change. Next I manually did the patch as there was a diff made for the patch but knowing how much stuff Luke put into his build of ST I didn't want to deal with the headache of dealing with merge conflicts so I just manually added the code to the repo. I also had to install a new <code>C</code> library called <code>harfbuzz</code> and add that in.</p>
<br>
<p>With all these items added I ran <code>sudo make install</code> again and tested out the feature and lo and behold.... I didn't have ligatures.... <strong>WTH</strong>... So I remembered that I was using Inconsolata for my font and I needed a font with ligature support. This turned out to be <code>FiraCode</code> But I didn't like the serifs on FiraCode so what I did was install <code>JetBrainsMono-Regular</code> as my font of choice and I couldn't be happier with the result. So to finish it off I ran <code>sudo make install</code> one more time, tested, aaaaaand we have ligatures. I have ligatures in Vim too because Vim is in the terminal, and now that I have the font in as well and figured out installing fonts onto Linux, I now also have ligatures in <strong>VSCode</strong> and <strong>RStudio</strong>. It was a journey, but I'm happy with this new build of ST and with my manually added in patch for ligatures I decided to have my own repo put up <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tallguyjenks/st">Here</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>Ultimately I think I will end up learning <code>C</code> and/or <code>C++</code> for writing terminal things, for faster functions in <code>R</code> and just the new dimension of programming, when I do I'll probably look at ST's code for learning and so it will help me learn how to modify my terminal more.</p>
