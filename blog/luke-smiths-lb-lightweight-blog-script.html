<p>So i finally got around to looking into <a href="www.lukesmith.xyz">Luke</a>'s <code>LB</code> script for blogging on a custom website like his. I gotta say that it <b>IS</b> so much nicer to use that script than doing what i was doing before...</p>

<p>Before <code>LB</code> this was my process:</p>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Write a draft post page</li>
	<li>Add preview page to the blog roll</li>
	<li>Add post to the blog index</li>
	<li>Add post to the <i>rss.xml</i> document</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
and all of this occurred in any order, it was a hassle and a waste of brain processing power to keep having to think in so many directions with all the file interations.
</p>
<p>I read the readme, and edited the shell script and this very first post is made with the <code>LB</code> shell script, and im already in love with it! i think i'll make a youtube video on it soon.</p>
