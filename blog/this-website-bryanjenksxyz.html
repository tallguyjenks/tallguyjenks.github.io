<p>So my website has suddenly just come together this weekend, out of a mix of boredom, insomnia, and my hyper focus gone awry, so i now finally have a home page up, with the <code>LB</code> script i also finaly have a blogging system in place that is light weight enough to be managable and have me post regularly on it, and as the posts continue i can continue to play with my <code>c3.js</code> chart. </p><br/>

<p>im highly enjoying the blog post writing with <code>LB</code> and intend to continue to use it more with my code discoveries, as well as my youtube videos and general blathering</p><br/>
