<p>In my video on getting YouTube subscription RSS links into NewsBoat (which can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/4JQ1N3upSFc">[HERE]</a>) I show how I saved myself loads of time by simply taking advantage of built in Vim behavior (macros) to easily structure and format almost 200 RSS feed links in a way that would work to be pasted into the NewsBoat URLS file and be good to go upon refresh.</p>
<br>
<p>This whole idea came from my own struggle of trying to do this on my windows machine when I was preparing to transition fully to this Linux system. I was barely halfway through before giving up due to frustration. Now I can simply run a few macros and I'm all set. It literally took me only a few minutes to hammer out the necessary macros, format my posts and prepare everything for a simple cut/paste and then I was off to the races. I have been getting heavily into NewsBoat content and documentation lately and this was one of the big things that keeps me in the browser, watching YouTube videos. Now I can do it with NewsBoat and mpv, and I don't get sucked into the recommendations algorithm or see any ads.</p>
<br>
<p>Highly recommend moving entirely to NewsBoat, it will change your life and how to consume digital content, and hopefully the video will help make that transition all the easier.</p>

<p>The video will premier on Tuesday May 5th 2020 at 0700</p>
