<p>So i have a video coming out soon on youtube about the program tellico, and with this FOSS program, im able to keep collections of items like a collection of books and their details. This program being FOSS the data isnt held in a proprietary format and im even able to export it to <code>HTML</code> and with this i took what styling the default export format had on it, reverse engineered it into <code>SASS</code> code and changed the colors to fit my website theme and so now i have a filterable, sortable table of my books in my library all on my site now.</p><br/>

<p>This is one of those hacky text based projects that once you work out the kinks, <b>REALLY</b> makes you appreciate Vim and general text editing tools. this just saved me a ton of time and manual work, and once i update my library in tellico i can just copy a paste a few lines of code over for the nav bar and some style sheet references and im good to go!</p>
