  <h2>Rust, Clang, Python, Oh My!</h2>
    <p>
      It's been a bit, i promise that i was intending to post more often than this
      but i've had a lot going on, as im sure most do during the holidays.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      So i have been playing around with <code>C</code>, <code>Rust</code>, and
      <code>Python</code> to see what i like about the languages. As with most
      programmers i feel, i learn best working with project based learning but my
      problem is that i cant think of projects i <b>really</b> want to make. I
      personally work best with business use cases and feel i learn best when im
      hacking on something at work for a reason that benefits my workplace or
      improves some facet of operations.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      I really like a lot of things about <code>Rust</code> and the
      <code>Rust</code> Community, namely how well documented it is, how many
      resources are out there for it, how much is being done for it's development,
      the emphasis on security, and interfaces with <code>C</code> code to begin
      migration to a more secure memory safe codebase. There's a lot to like about
      it but really i just don't really have a project idea in mind to tackle with
      it, but it does seem interesting, and to be a part of something that is just
      developing is always appealing to me.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      I hope that i eventually get the time to invest and actually find a project i
      want to work on with <code>Rust</code> because it seems like a cool language
      to develop with. All that said what have i actually been up to these days?
      well i've definitely been procrastinating on my websites development, i
      technically dont even have a homepage created yet, its just the blog stuff
      that's up and running so thats kind of sad, i really need to finish the home
      page...
    </p><br>
    <p>
      What i have been working on is a lot of work related use cases and
      programming,
    </p><br>
    <p> 
    <ul>
      <li><code>T-SQL</code> For querying an enterprise wide data warehouse</li>
      <li><code>R</code>* For all things stats, data analysis and data viz</li>
      <li>
        <code>HTML, CSS, JS</code> The web stack is weirdly coming in handy in this
        new role for some work
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>CCL</code> Cerner Command Language basically SQL with other stuff
        included to use for medical software querying
      </li>
      <li>
        And lots of other one off items and things for general development practices
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p><br>
    <p>
    *with <code>R</code> i actually got a connection set up to the data warehouse so
    i can effectively query directly from <code>RStudio</code> and just shove the
    query output into a data frame and create some data visualizations with the data
    using various packages like <code>ggplot2</code> which have yielded some cool
    results.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      I really enjoy the <code>R</code> language and all the things it has been
      stretched to do but also its beautiful charts and visualizations as well as
      documentation it can create. I have said it before but i like with programming
      to have a product as fast as possible as it is much easier to stay motivated
      with programming to have a project or visceral product produced that you can
      refine and hack on. <code>R</code> can send email, create interactive
      dashboards, produce a variety of documentation and presentations with markdown
      syntax and <code>R</code> code. It is a quirky language but theres a lot i
      like about it and i hope to continue to use it more along with
      <code>T-SQL</code> and the front end web stack.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      I have several videos planned for my youtube channel on various linux and
      programming things some of which are related to the topics covered here but
      ill produce a write-up for them on here
      <i>(this is me being optimistic about my ability to commit to blogging)</i>.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Today i actually saw in a newsletter im subscribed to for
      <code>R</code> related material, a package called <code>patchwork</code> that
      makes it easier to consolidate <code>R</code> visuals into a single image and
      group items together and i tested it out and it is great! the syntax to create
      these grouped visuals is very human friendly, here's some sample code and
      output you can run in R studio to see the result:
    </p><br>
    <pre><code>
      ```{r}

    library(patchwork)
    library(ggplot2)
    # A few more plots to play with
    p1 &lt;- ggplot(mpg) + 
      geom_point(aes(hwy, displ))
    p2 &lt;- ggplot(mpg) + 
      geom_bar(aes(manufacturer, fill = stat(count))) + 
      coord_flip()
    p3 &lt;- ggplot(mpg) + 
      geom_smooth(aes(hwy, cty)) + 
      facet_wrap(~year)
    p4 &lt;- ggplot(mpg) + 
      geom_tile(aes(factor(cyl), drv, fill = stat(count)), stat = 'bin2d')

    (p1 | p2) /
      p3

    layout &lt;- '
                ABB
                CCD
            '
    p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + plot_layout(design = layout)

    ```
    </code></pre><br>

      As for my current projects, im still trying to finish this darn website to a
      point that is not embaressing, at work im trying to wrap my head around Shiny
      dashboards developed as <code>R</code> packages with
      <code>testthat</code> unit tests and all.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      i guess that is all for now, always a lot going on but im just trying to
      increase my programming skills while maintaining my health and fitness, which
      means at home i try to prioritize health and fitness and at work i hope for
      business use cases to sharpen my programming skills so that i can devote more
      of my personal time to exercise and health to support the worklife. Lately its
      been the keto diet, a calisthenics program by <b>FitnessFAQ</b> on youtube,
      which i am <b>LOVING</b> with nightly 3mi walks and sometimes longer hikes on
      the weekends with the lady.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      well thats enough rambling for now, if you'd like to ever change just shoot me
      an email at
      <a href="mailto:bryanjenks@protonmail.com">bryanjenks@protonmail.com</a>.
    </p><br>
    <p>cheers!</p>
