<p>So today marks the day when i decided to pretty much do a video series on <code>RMarkdown</code>. I love <code>RMarkdown</code> as the medium for a variety of things in my daily life namely:</p>
<br>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Business Reports</li>
	<li>Data Analysis (EDA) Documents</li>
	<li>Markdown Documentation</li>
	<li>HTML Wiki Documents with the tabsets</li>
	<li>A Flexible Jupyter like document with multi-lang support</li>
	<li>LaTeX support without the bloat or learning curve</li>
	<li>Bib file support for references when i cite sources</li>
	<li>Great looking documents with minimal effort and code</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>The benefits go on and on. I cannot stop raving about <code>RMarkdown</code> I was using <code>LaTeX</code> to take some research notes on a viking burial and archeological site in York, but quickly just the syntax to make a bullet list is maddeningly long:</p>
<br>
<p>
<pre>
<code>
&#92;begin{itemize}
&#92;item item1
&#92;item item2
&#92;item item3
&#92;end{itemize}</code>
</pre></p>
<br>
<p>Thats just crazy right?! just to make a bullet list when in markdown type documents all you need is some dashes:</p>
<br>
<p>
<pre>
<code>
- item1
- item2
- item3
</code>
</pre>
</p>
<br>
<p>Im sure that once you reach the realm of complex thesis and dissertation writing, scientific journaling, or other high level, large volume publication type work that the specific skill set of <code>LaTeX</code> will become essential, but more most intents and purposes i find that <code>RMarkdown</code> can suffice for all my needs to not only <b>GREAT</b> looking documents, but can act like a jupyter notebook, can cite references with a <code>bib</code> file, and has limitless levels of customization and flexibility.</p>
<br>
<p>All of this fails to mention the <b>R</b> packages:</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li><code>Pagedown</code></li>
	<li><code>Blogdown</code></li>
	<li><code>Bookdown</code></li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>These packages allow you to create long documents, even whole books, with all the power and customization of <code>RMarkdown</code>. Sure there may be some niche areas and edge cases where <code>LaTeX</code> just cannot be beat, but <code>RMarkdown</code> also supports <code>LaTeX</code> sytax and math equations so until you reach the highest levels of technical need for <code>LaTeX</code>, <code>RMarkdown</code> <b>REALLY</b> can seem to do it all for you and take you very far with a lot less of a learning curve and more approachable and less overwhelming syntax and list of options.</p>
<br>
<p>Also this brings up the fact that many books on <code>R</code> and <code>RMarkdown</code> are free and open source online, and give a very user friendly approach into the world of <code>RMarkdown.</code></p>
