<p>So i absolute adore <code>RMarkdown</code> and recently i noticed a golden opportunity for me to contribute something to LARBS, this meta distribution of Arch Linux that i use and adore. I noticed that when compiling <code>RMarkdown</code> documents to pdf that the conversion through pandoc was <b>very</b> verbose and in <a href="www.lukesmith.xyz">Luke's</a> compiler script that it simple runs an <code>R</code> function that renders the <code>RMarkdown</code> document that i looked into it and that function call in <code>R</code> has a <code>quiet=TRUE</code> option which reduced the verbose messaging from pandoc down to just 3 lines. I put in a pull request and these changes were merged into master within a few hours. it felt really good to actually be able to contribute something back to this system i use and love so much, as well as finally having a real code project where i was able to contribute code instead of just issues to a repo. I talk about this in my video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQeEjvioEh0">HERE</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>In some of my other videos i have shown myself launching applications in the terminal but shell scripts i wrote to launch and disown the parent processes from the terminal window. I had a youtube subscriber/person ask me why i didnt just use <code>DMENU</code> to launch the applications.... I didn't know you could do that... though i should have guessed... so i tried it, and it works for everything, i just activate <code>DMENU</code> and type the name of my program and it finds the executable nad run it. So much easier than my previous process.</p>
