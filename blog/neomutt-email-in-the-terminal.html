<p>So i found neomutt and in general all things command line/terminal/larbs/linux, through <a href="www.lukesmith.xyz">Luke Smith</a> and i have come to adore neomutt.</p><br/>

<p>Neomutt makes my email so much easier to manage while on the same point making its faster, and minimizing my distraction with it because its just a text based application in the terminal so i dont get slowed down by loading internet resources or tracking cookies, and im more likely to just write my email and get on with my life. It's a kind of forced simplicity through digital minimalism.</p><br/>

<p>One thing i love most about neomutt is the <code>Vim</code> keybindings that work well with this whole system and realm of things, but also how easy it is to just pop into an email, open something, move something, delete something, etc. It's just another addition of efficiency in my life using text based terminal applications with <code>Vim</code> keybindings.</p><br/>

<p>I do notice that i personally have issues opening images with neomutt, im not sure what the problem is with that yet, but thus far it hasn't really effected or bothered me too much because i dont do a lot of email image viewing. I have made a youtube video on neomutt, and you can find that here: <a href="https://youtu.be/BJrZP1otDW4">Neomutt Video</a> </p><br/>

<p>Life is better in the terminal, and the more i use this system, the more i like it.</p><br/>
