<p>So today I finally sat down and got some of my backlogged TO-DO items done. One of these tasks was to create a new page on my website categorically listing out my 'works' both project based and those that I create with code i.e. software. </p>
<br>
<p>I went through most of my major or really useful projects and used what code I had on the site as it was and put together a fairly decent looking page. i also made some cosmetic changes to the home page and tidied a few things up.</p>
<br>
<p>Work has been super busy with a lot of new learning leaving me fairly tired and with little motivation to study, but I do plan to try to return to school this fall and apply my knowledge and experience to the academic process. I was dabbling with <code>python</code> a bit lately and even made a small sample project with it, but after reflecting on things and realizing my true interests, I think I'm going to continue deep diving into <code>R</code> and become the best <code>R</code> developer I can. I'm very interested in data science and statistics and want to continue my path into research. Currently I work as a <em>Research Data Analyst II</em> for my state agency, I want to continue performing research and learning everything I can about everything that interests me.</p>
<br>
<p>At work I have been refining my skills through application in several languages: <code>R, CCL, & T-SQL</code> I have several <code>R</code> books to read but also recently I made my first my first true <code>R</code> package complete with comprehensive documentation, semantic versioning changelog, 50+ unit tests, implemented with Travis CI, and most importantly; it got published to CRAN!. I'm very excited about <code>R</code> things these days and im even trying to push for it at work, but we'll see how that goes, but it is a language I really enjoy writing in, and I love the products it can easily produce. So hopefully more <code>R</code> content to come on my youtube channel!</p>
<br>
<p>If you'd like to try out my <code>R</code> package then simply run these commands: <code>install.packages("runes")</code> then <code>library(runes)</code> and finally: <code>runes("hello world!")</code>. Hope you all are well, and have a good night.</p>
