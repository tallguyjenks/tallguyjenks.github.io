<h2 id='task-management-with-taskwarrior-and-taskell'>Task management with Taskwarrior and Taskell</h2>
<p><small>[<a href='#task-management-with-taskwarrior-and-taskell'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/task-management-with-taskwarrior-and-taskell.html'>standalone</a>]</small></p>
<br/>
<p>Those that know me know that to keep my <b>ADHD</b> in check, i need/use a variety of task management strategies. </p><br/>

<p>It used to be post it notes everywhere, and a bullet journal, and to a point a lot of these things were very effective for me and to some degree or in some form i still make use of them.</p><br/>

<p>But what about a comprehensive task management system for complicated projects, or multiple projects, with timeframe, dependencies, notes on tasks, or links to additional resources, burndown reports, or other types of reports, and most of all, in the command line, using just text in the terminal, that is both user friendly, and in an exportable data format and not a proprietary one? Enter <b>TaskWarrior</b>. This program is a behemoth of complexity but <b>can</b> be used simply. There is a plethora of functionality and unlimited possibilities for workflows that you can do with task warrior and it is a <b>Great</b> tool for more complicated project management.</p><br/>

<p>With taskwarrior you also have the option of having extentions added to the program to extend the functionality of the program and in my case one such program i use frquently is called <code>taskopen</code> i use this to change the notes on the tasks to open markdown documents as the annotations so that each task can include a whole page of notes or more, and beyond markdown if you set the annotation to a URL taskopen will open the link in our default browser. The combo of taskwarrior with taskopen was a game changer for me.</p><br/>

<p>Now with all that firepower sometimes with that increased complexity comes increased distraction which is what happened in my case. Taskwarrior is great but it was a little much for my daily chore and errand list and what other little items i wanted to deal with. It would have been better suited for a work environment for me personally. A program that <b>does</b> however fit my more basic needs in this regard is <code>taskell</code> its a task management program written in haskell, and it provides the ability to manage your tasks in a way that i like best: <em>Kanban</em>. So taskell is an ncurses based terminal application that is driven by a single markdown document, (though it is possible to use trello as a back end, only to populate the board initially) and have your tasks displayed in the kanban swimlanes.</p><br/>

<p>Using Vim keybindings you can move, delete, update, undo, etc. to each of your tasks. Tasks can have due dates, sub tasks, &amp; descriptions. It's just a more visual way of displaying and managing the tasks and information i need to quickly process and complete.</p><br/>

<p>So thats what i use primarily for my task managment day to day, Taskwarrior, and taskell, you can watch my video about these programs here: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z3FtJ9xzn0g">Task Management Video</a>.</p><br/>

<br/>
<p>So my website has suddenly just come together this weekend, out of a mix of boredom, insomnia, and my hyper focus gone awry, so i now finally have a home page up, with the <code>LB</code> script i also finaly have a blogging system in place that is light weight enough to be managable and have me post regularly on it, and as the posts continue i can continue to play with my <code>c3.js</code> chart. </p><br/>

<p>im highly enjoying the blog post writing with <code>LB</code> and intend to continue to use it more with my code discoveries, as well as my youtube videos and general blathering</p><br/>

<h2 id='neomutt-email-in-the-terminal'>Neomutt, Email in the Terminal</h2>
<p><small>[<a href='#neomutt-email-in-the-terminal'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/neomutt-email-in-the-terminal.html'>standalone</a>]</small></p>
<br/>
<p>So i found neomutt and in general all things command line/terminal/larbs/linux, through <a href="www.lukesmith.xyz">Luke Smith</a> and i have come to adore neomutt.</p><br/>

<p>Neomutt makes my email so much easier to manage while on the same point making its faster, and minimizing my distraction with it because its just a text based application in the terminal so i dont get slowed down by loading internet resources or tracking cookies, and im more likely to just write my email and get on with my life. It's a kind of forced simplicity through digital minimalism.</p><br/>

<p>One thing i love most about neomutt is the <code>Vim</code> keybindings that work well with this whole system and realm of things, but also how easy it is to just pop into an email, open something, move something, delete something, etc. It's just another addition of efficiency in my life using text based terminal applications with <code>Vim</code> keybindings.</p><br/>

<p>I do notice that i personally have issues opening images with neomutt, im not sure what the problem is with that yet, but thus far it hasn't really effected or bothered me too much because i dont do a lot of email image viewing. I have made a youtube video on neomutt, and you can find that here: <a href="https://youtu.be/BJrZP1otDW4">Neomutt Video</a> </p><br/>

<p>Life is better in the terminal, and the more i use this system, the more i like it.</p><br/>

<h2 id='tellico-library-page-on-site'>tellico library page on site</h2>
<p><small>[<a href='#tellico-library-page-on-site'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/tellico-library-page-on-site.html'>standalone</a>]</small></p>
<br/>
<p>So i have a video coming out soon on youtube about the program tellico, and with this FOSS program, im able to keep collections of items like a collection of books and their details. This program being FOSS the data isnt held in a proprietary format and im even able to export it to <code>HTML</code> and with this i took what styling the default export format had on it, reverse engineered it into <code>SASS</code> code and changed the colors to fit my website theme and so now i have a filterable, sortable table of my books in my library all on my site now.</p><br/>

<p>This is one of those hacky text based projects that once you work out the kinks, <b>REALLY</b> makes you appreciate Vim and general text editing tools. this just saved me a ton of time and manual work, and once i update my library in tellico i can just copy a paste a few lines of code over for the nav bar and some style sheet references and im good to go!</p>

<h2 id='luke-smiths-lb-lightweight-blog-script'>Luke Smith's LB 'Lightweight Blog' Script</h2>
<p><small>[<a href='#luke-smiths-lb-lightweight-blog-script'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/luke-smiths-lb-lightweight-blog-script.html'>standalone</a>]</small></p>
<br/>
<p>So i finally got around to looking into <a href="www.lukesmith.xyz">Luke</a>'s <code>LB</code> script for blogging on a custom website like his. I gotta say that it <b>IS</b> so much nicer to use that script than doing what i was doing before...</p>

<p>Before <code>LB</code> this was my process:</p>
<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Write a draft post page</li>
	<li>Add preview page to the blog roll</li>
	<li>Add post to the blog index</li>
	<li>Add post to the <i>rss.xml</i> document</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>and all of this occurred in any order, it was a hassle and a waste of brain processing power to keep having to think in so many directions with all the file interations.</p>

<p>I read the readme, and edited the shell script and this very first post is made with the <code>LB</code> shell script, and im already in love with it! i think i'll make a youtube video on it soon.</p>
