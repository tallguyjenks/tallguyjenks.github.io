<h2 id='rstudioconf-videos-and-shiny'>RStudio::conf Videos and Shiny</h2>
<p><small>[<a href='#rstudioconf-videos-and-shiny'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/rstudioconf-videos-and-shiny.html'>standalone</a>]</small></p>
<br>
<p>This weekend i had planned to continue to read more data science research papers &amp; journals but then I managed to wander into the RStudio website and watched some of the talks from RStudio::conf 2020. I went down a rabbit hole and picked through the last 4&ndash;5 years and was up until 3am watching talks about Rproject templates, LaTeX templates, parameterization of RMarkdown documents, and how academics are using this medium to automate and ease their lives. I also watched a few on shiny.</p>
<br>
<p>Now, I feel its worth stating that I've bounced around several languages over the years just hopping around and learning the basics caught in tutorial hell but mostly just curious about everything and how different layers of software work. Now i think i'm finally settling on where i want to really put my time, energy, and focus. I have absolutely fallen in love with <code>R</code> and data science. I'm absolutely in love with writing <code>R</code> code and using RStudio to create packages, documents, analyze my data set, etc. I love <code>R</code> for many reasons, one is that it managed to keep my interest long enough and deeply enough that ive managed to get an ok level of skill with it. I like writing <code>R</code>. The next major factor was that the amount of effort it takes to create a decent looking, and somewhat useful product with R/Rmarkdown is so minimal it floored me. RMarkdown is one of the greatest things in the world to me, I do everything with it.</p>
<br>
<p>Watching these RStudio::conf videos inspired me to continue on this path, i LOVE <code>R</code> and I've already spent hundreds of dollars on books about <code>R</code> and im subscribed to several news letters, i've followed #rstats on twitter, I even have my own package on CRAN now. All of this is so exciting to me because i want to be really good at <code>R</code> but i also want to be able to use it for a practical purpose; i want to be good at data science. In learning <code>R</code>, using the RMarkdown medium, watching Luke Smith's videos, and seeing everyone on #rstats with PhD's, It's been ongoing for almost a year, but i want to return to school now and learn more about statistics and data science, this inspiration even has me learning about calculus when in school i was just not very motivated and kind of did well, but only because i was trying to just get schooling over with and get to work. Now im inspired to take my learning to the next level and apply these skills to production environments and real life business use cases. Life is very exiciting for me right now and im so inspired to continue learning.</p>

<h2 id='new-website-page-works'>New Website Page: 'Works'</h2>
<p><small>[<a href='#new-website-page-works'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/new-website-page-works.html'>standalone</a>]</small></p>
<br/>
<p>So today I finally sat down and got some of my backlogged TO-DO items done. One of these tasks was to create a new page on my website categorically listing out my 'works' both project based and those that I create with code i.e. software. </p>
<br>
<p>I went through most of my major or really useful projects and used what code I had on the site as it was and put together a fairly decent looking page. i also made some cosmetic changes to the home page and tidied a few things up.</p>
<br>
<p>Work has been super busy with a lot of new learning leaving me fairly tired and with little motivation to study, but I do plan to try to return to school this fall and apply my knowledge and experience to the academic process. I was dabbling with <code>python</code> a bit lately and even made a small sample project with it, but after reflecting on things and realizing my true interests, I think I'm going to continue deep diving into <code>R</code> and become the best <code>R</code> developer I can. I'm very interested in data science and statistics and want to continue my path into research. Currently I work as a <em>Research Data Analyst II</em> for my state agency, I want to continue performing research and learning everything I can about everything that interests me.</p>
<br>
<p>At work I have been refining my skills through application in several languages: <code>R, CCL, & T-SQL</code> I have several <code>R</code> books to read but also recently I made my first my first true <code>R</code> package complete with comprehensive documentation, semantic versioning changelog, 50+ unit tests, implemented with Travis CI, and most importantly; it got published to CRAN!. I'm very excited about <code>R</code> things these days and im even trying to push for it at work, but we'll see how that goes, but it is a language I really enjoy writing in, and I love the products it can easily produce. So hopefully more <code>R</code> content to come on my youtube channel!</p>
<br>
<p>If you'd like to try out my <code>R</code> package then simply run these commands: <code>install.packages("runes")</code> then <code>library(runes)</code> and finally: <code>runes("hello world!")</code>. Hope you all are well, and have a good night.</p>

<br/>
<p>So i've had a lot of projects going on lately but im very excited about them. First i've been loading a lot of new content to youtube namely a lot of videos on <code>RMarkdown</code>, but now i have another new series coming out. My new series on youtube at this playlist: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3baSluixcd4&list=PL5fd4SsfvECyFyM-jf2SFf4XCnfjbiWrX">HERE</a>. This playlist focuses on comprehensive reviewing of functionality as well as real applications of the functions in the packages so they can immediately be used.</p>
<br>
<p>Im very excited by these projects becase i <b>LOVE</b> talking about <code>R</code> and by teaching about the packages it acutally causes me to learn more so i understand the material being presented.</p>
<br>
<p>At work i've basically written a book with the <code>R</code> package <code>Bookdown</code> on a proprietary computer language we use, but beyond that project and some one off assignments i've mostly been devoting my time, resources, and money to learning more <code>R</code>. I have spent almost $200 on <code>R</code> books lately and im learning more about the language every day. I have even developed my own <code>R</code> package at work for use in our assignments. Complete with <code>Roxygen2</code> documentation, <code>testthat</code> unit tests, and more. It has been a blast.</p>
<br>
<p>Lastly I got a bit obsessed with putting elder futhark nordic runes into my terminal emulator: <b>ST</b>. After figuring out that <b>ST</b> supports UTF&ndash;8 i changed my linux <code>$PS1</code> variable to show my terminal prompt user and host name in elder futhark runes. Now, me knowing that this was possible didn't stop there. No, i wrote a shell script that can read standard input and even a whole file and with tests and a lot of piped <code>sed</code> regex functions i can convert whole files to runes. Now i can work on being able to read them as well as english haha. If this script and the project interest you or you want to check them out, you can do so <a href="https://github.com/tallguyjenks/runes">At This Link</a> Thats all the updates i have right now, keep your eyes on my youtube and github for content :)</p>

<br/>
<p>So i absolute adore <code>RMarkdown</code> and recently i noticed a golden opportunity for me to contribute something to LARBS, this meta distribution of Arch Linux that i use and adore. I noticed that when compiling <code>RMarkdown</code> documents to pdf that the conversion through pandoc was <b>very</b> verbose and in <a href="www.lukesmith.xyz">Luke's</a> compiler script that it simple runs an <code>R</code> function that renders the <code>RMarkdown</code> document that i looked into it and that function call in <code>R</code> has a <code>quiet=TRUE</code> option which reduced the verbose messaging from pandoc down to just 3 lines. I put in a pull request and these changes were merged into master within a few hours. it felt really good to actually be able to contribute something back to this system i use and love so much, as well as finally having a real code project where i was able to contribute code instead of just issues to a repo. I talk about this in my video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQeEjvioEh0">HERE</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>In some of my other videos i have shown myself launching applications in the terminal but shell scripts i wrote to launch and disown the parent processes from the terminal window. I had a youtube subscriber/person ask me why i didnt just use <code>DMENU</code> to launch the applications.... I didn't know you could do that... though i should have guessed... so i tried it, and it works for everything, i just activate <code>DMENU</code> and type the name of my program and it finds the executable nad run it. So much easier than my previous process.</p>

<br/>
<p>Im actually learning to love the code snippet functionality of <code>vim</code> quite a lot.</p>
<br>
<p>The power of <code>vim</code> is that fingers are always on the keyboard and that the <em>language</em> of <code>vim</code> i.e. the thought that <code>diw</code> inside <code>vim</code> is <em>delete inner word</em> makes it powerful to incorporate these actions of text and word objects while simultaniously creating code snippets and modification of the code through these actions.</p>
<br>
<p>This really came in handy with inserting images in <code>RMarkdown</code> instead of using the markdown syntax for image insertion that i for some reason seem to have such trouble with.</p>

<h2 id='r-markdown-is-superior-to-latex'>R Markdown is superior to LaTeX</h2>
<p><small>[<a href='#r-markdown-is-superior-to-latex'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/r-markdown-is-superior-to-latex.html'>standalone</a>]</small></p>
<br/>
<p>So today marks the day when i decided to pretty much do a video series on <code>RMarkdown</code>. I love <code>RMarkdown</code> as the medium for a variety of things in my daily life namely:</p>
<br>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Business Reports</li>
	<li>Data Analysis (EDA) Documents</li>
	<li>Markdown Documentation</li>
	<li>HTML Wiki Documents with the tabsets</li>
	<li>A Flexible Jupyter like document with multi-lang support</li>
	<li>LaTeX support without the bloat or learning curve</li>
	<li>Bib file support for references when i cite sources</li>
	<li>Great looking documents with minimal effort and code</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>The benefits go on and on. I cannot stop raving about <code>RMarkdown</code> I was using <code>LaTeX</code> to take some research notes on a viking burial and archeological site in York, but quickly just the syntax to make a bullet list is maddeningly long:</p>
<br>
<p>
<pre>
<code>
&#92;begin{itemize}
&#92;item item1
&#92;item item2
&#92;item item3
&#92;end{itemize}</code>
</pre></p>
<br>
<p>Thats just crazy right?! just to make a bullet list when in markdown type documents all you need is some dashes:</p>
<br>
<p>
<pre>
<code>
- item1
- item2
- item3
</code>
</pre>
</p>
<br>
<p>Im sure that once you reach the realm of complex thesis and dissertation writing, scientific journaling, or other high level, large volume publication type work that the specific skill set of <code>LaTeX</code> will become essential, but more most intents and purposes i find that <code>RMarkdown</code> can suffice for all my needs to not only <b>GREAT</b> looking documents, but can act like a jupyter notebook, can cite references with a <code>bib</code> file, and has limitless levels of customization and flexibility.</p>
<br>
<p>All of this fails to mention the <b>R</b> packages:</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li><code>Pagedown</code></li>
	<li><code>Blogdown</code></li>
	<li><code>Bookdown</code></li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>These packages allow you to create long documents, even whole books, with all the power and customization of <code>RMarkdown</code>. Sure there may be some niche areas and edge cases where <code>LaTeX</code> just cannot be beat, but <code>RMarkdown</code> also supports <code>LaTeX</code> sytax and math equations so until you reach the highest levels of technical need for <code>LaTeX</code>, <code>RMarkdown</code> <b>REALLY</b> can seem to do it all for you and take you very far with a lot less of a learning curve and more approachable and less overwhelming syntax and list of options.</p>
<br>
<p>Also this brings up the fact that many books on <code>R</code> and <code>RMarkdown</code> are free and open source online, and give a very user friendly approach into the world of <code>RMarkdown.</code></p>

<br/>
<p>So i've been watching some of <a href="www.lukesmith.xyz">Luke's</a> videos on <code>LaTeX</code> and was writing some notes i was taking on a book about a viking excavation site and their findings exclusively in <code>LaTeX</code>. So this document is all about viking leather work and since i also run a leather working business and perform as a viking at local renaissance faires, i want my skit as a merchant to be time period correct leather work.</p>
<br/>

<p>I Digress, i was writing all my pertinant findings in <code>LaTeX</code> and as far as i had gotten i liked it well enough, but Luke was right, it is a hefty install, and the learning curve is steep. There are a few things like macros in <code>LaTeX</code> i cant really imagine replicating at this point, but for most of my purposes, ill probably never need them.</p>
<br/>

<p>So after watching more of Luke's <code>LaTeX</code> videos i re-watched his videos on <code>RMarkdown</code>. Now i <b>LOVE</b> <code>RMarkdown</code>, it's one of my favorite things to use not only at work, but also at home, and were i to return, at school. <code>RMarkdown</code> make note taking, documentation, data analysis and reporting, and much more SO much easier. Once i saw Luke talking about how with <code>pandoc-citeproc</code> that the same power of a bib/bibber file for <code>LaTeX</code> can be replicated seamlessly in <code>RMarkdown</code> and pretty much all the benefits of <code>LaTeX</code> i figured there's really no reason to use anything else. So i moved my notes over to <code>RMarkdown</code> and i plan to use it for pretty much everything for ever.</p>
<br/>

<p>Given my love for <code>RMarkdown</code> i planned to do some videos on it, and i finally got around to writing my ideas out on various topics i could cover on RMarkdown, and it turns out its like 16 ideas so far, so there will be a lot of <code>RMarkdown</code> vidos to come in the future.</p>

<h2 id='task-management-with-taskwarrior-and-taskell'>Task management with Taskwarrior and Taskell</h2>
<p><small>[<a href='#task-management-with-taskwarrior-and-taskell'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/task-management-with-taskwarrior-and-taskell.html'>standalone</a>]</small></p>
<br/>
<p>Those that know me know that to keep my <b>ADHD</b> in check, i need/use a variety of task management strategies. </p><br/>

<p>It used to be post it notes everywhere, and a bullet journal, and to a point a lot of these things were very effective for me and to some degree or in some form i still make use of them.</p><br/>

<p>But what about a comprehensive task management system for complicated projects, or multiple projects, with timeframe, dependencies, notes on tasks, or links to additional resources, burndown reports, or other types of reports, and most of all, in the command line, using just text in the terminal, that is both user friendly, and in an exportable data format and not a proprietary one? Enter <b>TaskWarrior</b>. This program is a behemoth of complexity but <b>can</b> be used simply. There is a plethora of functionality and unlimited possibilities for workflows that you can do with task warrior and it is a <b>Great</b> tool for more complicated project management.</p><br/>

<p>With taskwarrior you also have the option of having extentions added to the program to extend the functionality of the program and in my case one such program i use frquently is called <code>taskopen</code> i use this to change the notes on the tasks to open markdown documents as the annotations so that each task can include a whole page of notes or more, and beyond markdown if you set the annotation to a URL taskopen will open the link in our default browser. The combo of taskwarrior with taskopen was a game changer for me.</p><br/>

<p>Now with all that firepower sometimes with that increased complexity comes increased distraction which is what happened in my case. Taskwarrior is great but it was a little much for my daily chore and errand list and what other little items i wanted to deal with. It would have been better suited for a work environment for me personally. A program that <b>does</b> however fit my more basic needs in this regard is <code>taskell</code> its a task management program written in haskell, and it provides the ability to manage your tasks in a way that i like best: <em>Kanban</em>. So taskell is an ncurses based terminal application that is driven by a single markdown document, (though it is possible to use trello as a back end, only to populate the board initially) and have your tasks displayed in the kanban swimlanes.</p><br/>

<p>Using Vim keybindings you can move, delete, update, undo, etc. to each of your tasks. Tasks can have due dates, sub tasks, &amp; descriptions. It's just a more visual way of displaying and managing the tasks and information i need to quickly process and complete.</p><br/>

<p>So thats what i use primarily for my task managment day to day, Taskwarrior, and taskell, you can watch my video about these programs here: <a href="https://youtu.be/Z3FtJ9xzn0g">Task Management Video</a>.</p><br/>

<p>So my website has suddenly just come together this weekend, out of a mix of boredom, insomnia, and my hyper focus gone awry, so i now finally have a home page up, with the <code>LB</code> script i also finaly have a blogging system in place that is light weight enough to be managable and have me post regularly on it, and as the posts continue i can continue to play with my <code>c3.js</code> chart. </p><br/>

<br/>
<p>So i found neomutt and in general all things command line/terminal/larbs/linux, through <a href="www.lukesmith.xyz">Luke Smith</a> and i have come to adore neomutt.</p><br/>

<p>Neomutt makes my email so much easier to manage while on the same point making its faster, and minimizing my distraction with it because its just a text based application in the terminal so i dont get slowed down by loading internet resources or tracking cookies, and im more likely to just write my email and get on with my life. It's a kind of forced simplicity through digital minimalism.</p><br/>

<p>One thing i love most about neomutt is the <code>Vim</code> keybindings that work well with this whole system and realm of things, but also how easy it is to just pop into an email, open something, move something, delete something, etc. It's just another addition of efficiency in my life using text based terminal applications with <code>Vim</code> keybindings.</p><br/>

<p>I do notice that i personally have issues opening images with neomutt, im not sure what the problem is with that yet, but thus far it hasn't really effected or bothered me too much because i dont do a lot of email image viewing. I have made a youtube video on neomutt, and you can find that here: <a href="https://youtu.be/BJrZP1otDW4">Neomutt Video</a> </p><br/>

<p>Life is better in the terminal, and the more i use this system, the more i like it.</p><br/>

<p>So i have a video coming out soon on youtube about the program tellico, and with this FOSS program, im able to keep collections of items like a collection of books and their details. This program being FOSS the data isnt held in a proprietary format and im even able to export it to <code>HTML</code> and with this i took what styling the default export format had on it, reverse engineered it into <code>SASS</code> code and changed the colors to fit my website theme and so now i have a filterable, sortable table of my books in my library all on my site now.</p><br/>

<p>This is one of those hacky text based projects that once you work out the kinks, <b>REALLY</b> makes you appreciate Vim and general text editing tools. this just saved me a ton of time and manual work, and once i update my library in tellico i can just copy a paste a few lines of code over for the nav bar and some style sheet references and im good to go!</p>

<br/>
<p>So i finally got around to looking into <a href="www.lukesmith.xyz">Luke</a>'s <code>LB</code> script for blogging on a custom website like his. I gotta say that it <b>IS</b> so much nicer to use that script than doing what i was doing before...</p>

<p>Before <code>LB</code> this was my process:</p>
<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Write a draft post page</li>
	<li>Add preview page to the blog roll</li>
	<li>Add post to the blog index</li>
	<li>Add post to the <i>rss.xml</i> document</li>
</ul>
