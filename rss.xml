        So ive decided to start a blog on this website, and talk about my various doings and interests. To start, what am i currently up to?
    </p><br/>
    <p>
        Currently i am working on developing my javascript skills and using front end web technologies at work to develop i guess what you'd consider embedded web apps in my agency's medical software. I find it all very fascinating, so far ive had to learn about Jquery, D3, C3, and Datatable.js. I really enjoyed the data visualization of C3 JS and the easier syntax than D3 code, so i even incorporated a chart onto this site for the sake of see blogpost volume.
    </p><br/>
    <p>
        As of now i am currently working on learning HTML, SASS/CSS, JavaScript for the embedded web applications, 2 different types of SQL for database queries and API JSON returns to use in these web app visualizations, and also using R for mostly documentation right now, but i hope to get to learn R better with business use cases like shiny dashboard creation, and R Markdown reports and actual statistics and analytics. 
    </p><br/>
    <p>
        At home i am looking at more Javascript type stuff like higher order array methods, and ES6 related functions to see if i can test them in my agency's software and take advantage of them, and also wanting to see if a framework like Vue.js could potentially work for the purposes of what is needed. I also want to try my hand at TDD (Test Driven Development) and develop unit tests for our Javascript files and see if we can make a very robust system for testing and refactoring. 
    </p><br/>
    <p>
        At home i am studying more Linux things as im running an arch system thanks to <a href='http://www.lukesmith.xyz'>Luke Smith</a>'s <a href='http://www.larbs.xyz'>LARBS script</a>. I love the system that luke developed and ive been adding and removing things to it to suit my needs as i go and ive been loving it. Ive completely migrated from my windows system to this system and terminal applications. With terminal applications came the fascination with lower level terminal programming and console related applications, so ive been now attempting to learn C-lang, and to better use my current system ive also been studying Bash scripting and general commands and this whole site is really inspired by luke's and the ability to have an RSS feed with these posts in them to read in newsboat. 
    </p><br/>
    <p>
        Well i have a lot going on lately but i hope to make more of these posts and enjoy this process a time goes on. some of the next tasks are to fix some things on this site, and once this site is really up and running, i plan to leave facebook and hopefully experience more digital minimalism. I'd also like to just feel like i can read more and work on my leather work projects without always being distracted by the digital world, but knowing nerdy me this is an impossibility. Well for now thats all, and i will return with further ramblings in the future!
